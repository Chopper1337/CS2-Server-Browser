# CS2 Server Browser

Application designed to allow for users of unofficial copies of CS2 to easily connect to various servers.

Servers are added to the application via a text file named "servers.txt" which should contain server data in the following format:

`Server Name, IP, Port, Gamemode`

Example:

`DUST2 24/7 DEATHMATCH, 99.88.77.66, 27015, Deathmatch`
`DUST2 5v5 Competitive, 99.88.77.63, 27016, Competitive`
